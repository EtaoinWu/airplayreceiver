# AirPlay Receiver
Open source implementation of AirPlay 2 Mirroring / Audio protocol in C# .Net Core.  

## Disclamier
This project is for educational purposes only.  
I do not take any responsibility for the use that will be made of it.  

## Generic

I will post more information about the project soon.  
Tested on macOS with iPhone 12 Pro iOS14.  
  
The project is fully functional, but the AAC and ALAC libraries written in C ++ must be built.  
  
I had compiled them for macOS. I haven't tried on Windows.  
  
I also wanted to point out that the code could be written better, but I had written it just for fun.  
When I have a little more time, I'll fix it.  
  
I still have to insert some references from which I took inspiration.
